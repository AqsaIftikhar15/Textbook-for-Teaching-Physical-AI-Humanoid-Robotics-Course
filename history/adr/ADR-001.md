## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book needed to be structured in a pedagogically sound way that progresses from fundamentals to advanced concepts. The target audience consists of students and practitioners with intermediate Python, ML, and AI experience who want to understand humanoid robotics from middleware to multimodal AI integration. The challenge was to organize the content in a way that builds knowledge progressively without overwhelming students or creating gaps in understanding.

## Decision
Organize the book into exactly four modules following this structure:
1. Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - 4 weeks covering ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, topics, services, actions, and URDF concepts
2. Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - 2 weeks covering physics simulation, environment building, and sensor simulation
3. Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - 5 weeks covering AI perception, path planning, Isaac platform, and humanoid development
4. Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - 1 week covering multimodal integration and conversational robotics

## Alternatives Considered
- **Single comprehensive book**: Would lack clear learning progression and make it difficult for students to track their progress
- **More granular modules**: Would fragment the learning experience and create unnecessary overhead in navigation and assessment
- **Different ordering**: Starting with AI concepts before middleware would not follow the natural progression from hardware to AI, making it harder for students to understand the complete system architecture

## Rationale
This architecture provides a logical progression from low-level middleware (ROS 2) to high-level AI integration (VLA), with simulation and perception/control as intermediate layers. Each module builds on the previous without duplication and creates a coherent learning journey. The duration allocation (4, 2, 5, 1 weeks) reflects the complexity and importance of each topic area.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear learning progression that builds from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- Each module has a focused scope that's manageable for students
- Prerequisite chain ensures students have necessary background knowledge
- Allows for focused assessment and validation of each concept area

### Negative
- Rigid structure that may not accommodate different learning paces
- Fixed duration may not suit all students' needs
- Dependencies between modules mean students can't skip ahead to topics of interest

### Constraints
- Students must complete modules in sequence
- Each module must be completed before starting the next
- Content must not duplicate concepts from other modules unnecessarily
