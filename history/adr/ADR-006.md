# ADR-006: Research-Concurrent Development Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-12-08

## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book covers cutting-edge topics in robotics, AI, and multimodal systems where technology is rapidly evolving. The challenge is to ensure content remains current and accurate while being developed, rather than conducting all research upfront before writing begins. The traditional approach of completing all research before writing could result in outdated content by the time of completion.

## Decision
Use a research-concurrent approach where research is conducted while writing each module rather than all upfront. This means:
- Research is performed as needed during content development
- Sources are verified and validated during the writing process
- Content is updated based on the latest research findings
- Academic rigor is maintained throughout the development process

## Alternatives Considered
- **All-research-first approach**: Complete all research before beginning content development. This was rejected because technology in robotics and AI evolves rapidly and early research might become outdated.
- **Post-development research**: Add citations and research after content is written. This was rejected because it would be difficult to integrate research properly into the narrative flow.

## Rationale
The research-concurrent approach ensures content remains current with the latest developments in robotics, AI, and multimodal systems. It allows for continuous validation of concepts and integration of new findings as the book is developed. This approach aligns with the academic rigor requirement while ensuring content relevance for the target audience.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Content remains current with latest research and developments
- Continuous validation of concepts during development
- Better integration of research findings into the narrative
- Maintains academic rigor throughout the development process
- Allows for adaptation to new developments in rapidly evolving fields

### Negative
- Potentially longer development time due to concurrent research
- Risk of content changes as new research emerges
- Requires more coordination between research and writing phases
- May require iterative updates as new information becomes available

### Constraints
- Research must be conducted concurrently with content development
- All content must maintain academic rigor standards
- Sources must be properly cited using APA format
- Content must be updated when new relevant research emerges
