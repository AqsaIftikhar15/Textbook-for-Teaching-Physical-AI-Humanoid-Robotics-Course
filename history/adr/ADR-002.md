# ADR-002: Conceptual-First Pedagogical Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-12-08

## Context
The target audience for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book consists of students and practitioners with intermediate Python, ML, and AI experience. These learners need to understand the fundamental principles and concepts of humanoid robotics before diving into implementation details. The challenge is to ensure deep conceptual understanding while avoiding overwhelming students with technical implementation complexity that could obscure the core concepts.

## Decision
Emphasize conceptual understanding using diagrams and pseudo-code, avoiding technical implementation details. All code examples will be conceptual pseudo-code rather than executable implementations. The focus will be on explaining "why" before "how", using visual aids and mathematical explanations to illustrate concepts without requiring hands-on execution.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Implementation-first approach**: Start with hands-on coding and build conceptual understanding through practice. This was rejected because it would overwhelm students with technical details and potentially obscure the core concepts.
- **Equal balance approach**: Provide equal focus on conceptual and implementation aspects. This was rejected because it would dilute the conceptual focus required by the constraints and potentially confuse students about priorities.

## Rationale
This approach allows focus on "why" before "how", which is appropriate for the target audience's knowledge level. It enables students to understand system architecture and principles before getting distracted by implementation complexities. The approach aligns with cognitive load theory by reducing extraneous load from technical details while focusing on essential concepts.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better conceptual understanding of system architecture and principles
- Students can focus on the "why" behind robotics systems without being distracted by implementation details
- Approach is suitable for the target audience's intermediate knowledge level
- Allows for clear visualization of complex concepts through diagrams and pseudo-code

### Negative
- Students may lack hands-on implementation experience with the technologies
- May not adequately prepare students for practical implementation challenges
- Some learners might prefer hands-on experience to reinforce conceptual understanding

### Constraints
- All code examples must be pseudo-code, not executable implementations
- No hands-on execution required for any examples
- All diagrams must be explained both conceptually and mathematically
- Content must focus on understanding principles before implementation details
