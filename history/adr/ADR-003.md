# ADR-003: Technology Stack for Educational Book Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-12-08

## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book requires a documentation platform that can effectively present technical content, support visual aids (diagrams), and provide a good learning experience for students. The platform needs to support the Docusaurus documentation framework as specified in the constraints, be deployable on GitHub Pages, and handle the multi-module structure effectively. The challenge is to select a technology stack that meets these requirements while being maintainable and scalable.

## Decision
Use Docusaurus for documentation framework, deployed on GitHub Pages, with content in Markdown format. The technology stack includes:
- Docusaurus framework for documentation
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- Markdown format for content
- Node.js for build process
- Git for version control

## Alternatives Considered
- **GitBook**: Limited customization options and less flexibility for complex diagrams and mathematical content
- **Custom solution**: Higher maintenance overhead and would require building features that Docusaurus already provides
- **Other static site generators**: Less feature-rich than Docusaurus for technical documentation, with inferior search capabilities and documentation-specific features

## Rationale
Docusaurus provides excellent documentation features, search capabilities, and is well-suited for technical content with support for mathematical equations, diagrams, and code examples. GitHub Pages offers reliable hosting with seamless version control integration. The Markdown format is familiar to developers and integrates well with Git workflows. This stack aligns with the constraint requiring Docusaurus documentation standards.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent documentation features with search, navigation, and versioning
- Good support for technical content including diagrams and mathematical equations
- Seamless integration with GitHub for version control and deployment
- Well-established ecosystem with good community support
- Responsive design suitable for various device sizes

### Negative
- Dependency on Docusaurus ecosystem and its update cycles
- Learning curve for contributors unfamiliar with Docusaurus
- Potential performance considerations with large documentation sets
- Limited to Docusaurus' theming and customization capabilities

### Constraints
- Must follow Docusaurus documentation standards
- Deployment must use GitHub Pages
- Content must be in Markdown format
- Build process requires Node.js environment
