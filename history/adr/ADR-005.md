# ADR-005: Academic Citation and Quality Standards

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-12-08

## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book must maintain academic rigor and credibility by properly citing sources and following established academic standards. The challenge is to ensure all claims are properly attributed, maintain a minimum threshold of peer-reviewed sources, and follow consistent citation practices across all modules while meeting readability standards for the target audience.

## Decision
Follow APA citation style with minimum 60% peer-reviewed sources as required by the constitution. All content must follow Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 readability standard. Specific requirements include:
- APA format for all citations
- Minimum 60% peer-reviewed sources
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 readability
- Academic rigor in all content
- Proper attribution for all claims

## Alternatives Considered
- **Other citation styles** (IEEE, ACM, etc.): Would create inconsistency with academic standards
- **Lower peer-reviewed threshold**: Would reduce academic credibility and rigor
- **Different readability standards**: Either too simple or too complex for the target audience

## Rationale
Academic rigor requires proper attribution and verification of claims through credible sources. The 60% peer-reviewed threshold ensures credibility while allowing for industry documentation and practical sources. The readability standard ensures content is accessible to the target audience while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Maintains academic credibility and rigor
- Proper attribution of sources and research
- Consistent citation practices across all modules
- Credible content with verifiable claims
- Appropriate readability for target audience

### Negative
- Additional effort required for proper citation and verification
- May limit use of newer or emerging sources that aren't yet peer-reviewed
- Potential complexity in maintaining citation standards across all modules
- Readability constraints may limit technical depth in some areas

### Constraints
- All citations must follow APA format
- Minimum 60% of sources must be peer-reviewed
- All content must meet Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12 standard
- All claims must be verifiable through cited sources
