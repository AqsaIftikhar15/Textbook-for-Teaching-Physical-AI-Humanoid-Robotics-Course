# ADR-004: Conceptual Assessment Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-12-08

## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book follows a conceptual-first approach, which means traditional hands-on programming assessments may not align with the pedagogical goals. The challenge is to validate student understanding of complex robotics concepts without requiring implementation, ensuring assessments evaluate comprehension of principles, relationships, and applications rather than coding ability.

## Decision
Include conceptual assessments that validate understanding without requiring implementation. Assessment types include:
- Conceptual exercises that require explanation of principles
- Thought experiments that apply concepts to new scenarios
- Diagram-based questions that test understanding of system relationships
- Pseudo-code analysis that evaluates algorithmic thinking
- Multi-modal integration questions for advanced modules

## Alternatives Considered
- **Hands-on implementation projects**: Would conflict with the conceptual-first approach and overwhelm students with technical details
- **Mixed approach**: Part conceptual, part implementation. This was rejected as it would create inconsistency with the pedagogical approach
- **Multiple-choice only**: Would not adequately assess deep understanding of complex concepts

## Rationale
Since the focus is on conceptual understanding, assessments should evaluate comprehension of principles, relationships, and applications rather than coding ability. This approach aligns with the conceptual-first pedagogical approach and ensures students can explain key concepts within the time constraints specified in success criteria.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Aligns with conceptual-first pedagogical approach
- Focuses on understanding rather than implementation skills
- Allows assessment of complex concepts without technical barriers
- Validates comprehension of principles and relationships
- Suitable for the target audience's learning objectives

### Negative
- May not adequately prepare students for practical implementation challenges
- Could be less engaging for students who prefer hands-on learning
- Requires more sophisticated question design to effectively assess understanding
- May not reflect real-world implementation challenges

### Constraints
- All assessments must validate understanding without requiring implementation
- Assessment content must align with conceptual-first approach
- Success criteria must be measurable without hands-on execution
- Assessment design must accommodate the 30-minute explanation requirement
