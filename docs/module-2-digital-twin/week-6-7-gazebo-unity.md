# Robot Simulation with Gazebo and Unity

## Learning Objectives

- Understand digital twin concepts and their importance in humanoid robotics
- Explain physics simulation principles (gravity, collisions, forces) in Gazebo
- Understand environment building for humanoid robot training
- Recognize sensor simulation concepts (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Understand the role of Unity in high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction

## Overview

Simulation environments provide safe and cost-effective platforms for developing and testing humanoid robots. Digital twins bridge the gap between simulation and reality, enabling Sim2Real transfer techniques.
