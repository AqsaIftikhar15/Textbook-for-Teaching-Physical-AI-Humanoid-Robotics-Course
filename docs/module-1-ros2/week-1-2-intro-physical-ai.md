# Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Recognize the difference between digital AI and robots that understand physical laws
- Overview of humanoid robotics landscape
- Understand sensor systems: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors

## Overview

Physical AI represents the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI must understand and interact with the physical world governed by laws of physics, mechanics, and real-world constraints.
