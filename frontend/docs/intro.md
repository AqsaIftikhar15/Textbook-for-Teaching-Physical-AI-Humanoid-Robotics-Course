# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive educational book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book is structured as four progressive modules designed to build your understanding of humanoid robot systems from middleware to multimodal AI integration.

## Target Audience

This book is designed for students and practitioners with intermediate Python, machine learning, and AI experience who want to understand humanoid robotics from a conceptual perspective.

## Learning Approach

This book follows a conceptual-first approach, emphasizing understanding principles before implementation details. You will encounter:

- Conceptual diagrams explaining system architectures
- Pseudo-code examples illustrating algorithmic concepts
- Mathematical explanations alongside visual representations
- APA-formatted citations for academic rigor

## Module Structure

The book consists of four modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding middleware architecture
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Physics simulation and environment building
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - AI perception, navigation, and path planning
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal integration and conversational robotics

Each module builds upon previous concepts, creating a coherent learning journey from fundamentals to advanced applications.

## Academic Standards

All content follows APA citation format with a minimum of 60% peer-reviewed sources, maintaining academic rigor throughout the learning experience.
